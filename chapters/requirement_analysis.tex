In this chapter, we will examine a brief review of the project's functions and the system's scenarios and use cases. This section includes the entire functional specification.

\section{Overall System Requirements}
In general, this application should satisfy the following requirements:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A login system with authentication
  \item Users can upload and download files
  \item The system limited users with some features
  \begin{itemize}
    \item For Admin:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Manage Users
            \item Manage User Groups
            \item Access to all files and folders
            \item Grant or remove permissions for all files and folders
        \end{itemize}
    \item For Regular Users:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item View their own profile
            \item Update their own profile
            \item Access to files and folders they have permission to read and/or write
            \item Grant or remove permissions for the files or folders they own
        \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Users \& Non-functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Users Requirement}: Have a device with internet access, preferable Chrome web browser
    \item \textbf{Performance}: The website is accessible by anyone with a public domain. 
    \item \textbf{Availability}: The user can only work with the system fully if they can login with a registered account.
    \item \textbf{Re-usability}: User can use external files with the website. User can use CSV file generated from the website for other purposes. The data generated by the website can be use as the resource for other services.
    \item \textbf{Reliability}: The system will not work without the Internet connection.
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Cases}
\subsection{Use Cases Diagram}
The following diagram describes the functions that a user can perform with the system.

    \label{fig:description}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Users Characteristics}
Two types of users interact with the system: \textbf{Admin} and (regular) \textbf{User}. Each user type has different uses in the system, so each of them has its requirements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Admin}: a user who has access to all resources; only admin could manage user groups, total management of users
    \item \textbf{User}: a user who only has access to the resource they have permission to use, only could view and edit their profile.
\end{itemize}

\section{Use Case and Scenario Description}
\subsection{Use case: Register (SUB-FEATURE 1.1)}
\subsubsection{Brief description}
This use case describes how a user registers to the system. 
\subsubsection{Flow of events} 
\textbf{1. Basic Flow}

The table \ref{table:1} takes place when one person wants to create a new account on the system.
\begin{table}[H]

  \hline
  2. The Actor enters their information. & 3. The system check the entered account exists on the system or not with username and email & \\
  \hline
  & 4. The system validates userâ€™s information and create a new 
account for user and log the Actor into the system after created successfully & \\
  \hline 
\end{tabulary}
\caption{Register Basic Flow (SUB-FEATURE 1.1)}
\label{table:1}
\end{table}

\par
\textbf{2. Alternative Flows}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item Account exists \\
If in the Basic Flow, at step 3, the account has existed on the system, the system displays an error message. If the user goes back, return the form. The Actor can select to cancel the operation, at which point the Use Case ends.
    \item Invalid Format or Insufficient Information \\
If, in the Basic Flow, at step 2, the Actor has not specified sufficient information to create a new account as required, the system will prompt the Actor for the invalid field or the missing information. The Actor can either enter the missing information or cancel the operation, at which point the Use Case ends.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Special Requirement}
Only Regular Users can Register into the system. Admin is either pre-created or assigned an account. 
\subsubsection{Pre-conditions}
User is not logged in.
\subsubsection{Post-conditions}
If the use case is successful, the user registers successfully. If not, the system state is unchanged.

\subsection{Use case: Login (SUB-FEATURE 1.2)}

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Special Requirement}
None.
\subsubsection{Pre-conditions}
The user account must exist.

    \textbf{Actor Action} & 
    \textbf{System Action} & 
    \textbf{Data} \\

\textbf{2. Alternative Flows}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    \item ACL not found \\
If in Delete ACL sub flow, at step 3, a ACL with the specified id number does not exist, the system displays an error message. The users can cancel the operation, at which point the Use Case ends.
    \item The users do not have the permission to view\\
If, in the Basic Flow at step 2, the users do not have the right to view a file or a folder. They can not know the file or folder permission details. 
    \item The users do not have the permission to write\\
If, in the Delete sub flow, at step 2, the users do not have the right to write the selected file or folder. The users can choose to cancel the operation, at which point the Use Case ends.
    \item Invalid Format or Insufficient Information\\
If, in the Grant ACL sub flow, at step 5; the users have not specified sufficient information to add a new ACL, the system will prompt the users for the missing information. The users can either enter the missing information or choose to cancel the operation, at which point the Use Case ends.
