\section{Result}
After three months of development, the APIs and Dashboard for Data Lake has basically been completed, meeting the initial criteria. To be more specific, a website has been designed with the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Register and Login}: Allows users to create an account and log in using the registered account based on username and a real email.
    \item \textbf{Manage Users}: Allow Admin to read, create, edit, and delete information about users.
    \item \textbf{Manage User Groups}: Allow Admin to read, create, edit, and delete information about groups.
    \item \textbf{Manage Folders and Manage Files}: Authorized users are allowed to read, create, edit, and delete information about files and folders. To increase productivity, users can filter them by custom criteria.
    \item \textbf{Manage ACLs}: Authorized users are allowed to grant permission for other users on the files or folders they selected.
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
Despite being implemented completely, the main functions in this project have some existing
problems. 

The concept of Data Lake is new to us. And it takes a long time to get a sense of what it is and how to do.

Furthermore, because this website was not created by a team of experienced creators but by a novice individual, it contains numerous flaws in terms of design and features.

Finally, time constraints prevent the testing process from being completed completely and methodically, potentially resulting in a large number of minor problems. On the other hand, this website has accomplished all of the initial objectives listed in the Objectives chapter.
